100 words about todays class:
      in todays class i have learnt that in github where we store all the important files in the form of a repository comtains some files called README.md which is used by the uploder to help the people reading the repository understand what is the coding in the files related to and what method is used and all etc. this is a file which is programmed by a language called markdown language. the markdown language is a simple language which can be used to create content such as easy simple looking web pages. markdown is a light weight markup language and it is used fot creating formatted text using in a very simple plain text format like in python. it is very easy to operate more easier than html but to create simple webpages. in markdown language we use simgle # for title and ## for subtitle and ### for subsub tiutle and we have to provide space after the # for the markdown language file to execute properly.
